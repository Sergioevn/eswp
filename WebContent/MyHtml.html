		Rome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the
		world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and art
		treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the
		beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent
		"villas" (parks).<br /> <br /> Among the most significant resources:
		plenty of museums - (Capitoline Museums, the Vatican Museums, Galleria
		Borghese, and a great many others)-aqueducts, fountains, churches,
		palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the Roman
		Forum, and the Catacombs.<br /> Rome is the 3rd most visited city in
		the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7-10
		million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years.<br />
		The Colosseum (4 million tourists) and the Vatican Museums (4.2
		million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited
		places in the world, according to a recent study.<br /> In 2005 the
		city registered 19.5 million of global visitors, up of 22.1% from
		2001. In 2006, Rome was visited by 6.03 million international
		tourists, reaching 8th place in the ranking of the world's 150 most
		visited cities.<br /> The city has also been nominated 2007's fourth
		most desirable city to visit in the world, according to lifestyle
		magazine Travel + Leisure, after Florence, Buenos Aires and Bangkok.
		Rome is the city with the most monuments in the world. <br />Like
		other Italian cities, Rome charges a tourism tax which contributes
		towards the maintenance of public transportation and infrastructure.
		It ranges from &euro;3 to &euro;7 per person, per night, based on the
		hotel or other type of accommodation used (children under 10 years old
		are exempt, and the tax doesn't apply after 10 days).

		Berlin, the German capital, is renowned for its exceptional variety of
		attractions, its flourishing cultural scene and a way of life that's
		both fast-paced and relaxed.<br /> <br /> Contrasts between
		historical buildings and modern architecture, between the traditional
		and the modern are what set the city apart from the rest. The sights
		of Berlin - from the Brandenburg Gate to the Federal Chancellery -
		tell the story of an entire nation. <br />Germany's capital is home
		to all the major goverment buildings, most notably the historic
		Reichstag, seat of the German parliament.<br /> Berlin is a city of
		art, artists and museums. More than 170 museums, including those on
		the famous museum island, put the treasures of the world on public
		display. <br />Culturally minded visitors from all corners of the
		globe come to Berlin to see performances by leading orchestras - such
		as the internationally celebrated Berlin Philharmonic - and to attend
		ballets and operas at the three major opera houses.<br /> A multitude
		of theatres specialising in plays, variety, revue and cabaret offer
		stage entertainment in all its forms.<br /> The famous
		Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, grand old Friedrichstrasse and the independent
		boutiques in and around the Hackesche H&ouml;fe offer endless scope
		for shopping.<br /> Nowadays, people look to Berlin for the latest
		trends in lifestyle, music and art. Inspired by this outpouring of
		creativity, growing numbers of artists are arriving in the city from
		around the world, making it one of Europe's most exciting
		destinations.<br /> A feature of Berlin, aside from its exuberance,
		is the way it continuously reinvents itself.<br /> But Berlin also
		has a relaxed vibe and lots of open spaces for a breath of fresh air.
		No city in Germany is greener than Berlin with its forests, lakes and
		sprawling parks. This laid-back way of life can be found throughout
		the city. When the weather gets warmer, life in Berlin moves outdoors
		to the beach bars, pavement caf&eacute;s and open-air cinemas and
		theatres - perfect for enjoying the sunshine and the balmy summer
		nights.<br />
